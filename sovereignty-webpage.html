	<p>Embark on adventures with your Discord friends through <b>SOVEREIGNTY</b>! Sovereignyu is a bot that allows members of the servers in which it is embdedded to be able to team up in order to complete quests in an RPG fashion. It has already been encoded with a sample adventure for Discord members to try out, but anyone with a Discord accounthas the ability to create their very own adventure: including you!<br>
	</p>
	<p>The bot has been built using discord.py and the images have been taken from pexels.com’s API and Unsplash.com. All of the code has been written in Python. This bot allows all of the members of any Discord server to create their own fictional characters who can be used within RPG style games created by admins in the server. Outside of the RPGs, the characters can be used within the server’s world; users can have jobs, and are able to care for their character. After the bot is added to a server, members can create their own characters and choose their own profession. Members can use these characters within the server’s environment, their own custom RPG adventures, or the sample RPG that has been provided.<br>
	</p>
	<p>The developers of this bot are continuously working on improving the sample quests that are provided by the bot and the choices available to the members that decide to use it! There will be new features coming up in the future, but with the release of Sovereignty comes one sample campaign for Discord members to enter, whether individually or with others, a chance to customize characters including their names and professions, and different ways your campaign can end! If you're interested in the mystery of the Forgotten Kingdom or wish to create and defeat your own quests with a team, add Sovereignty into your Discord Server!
